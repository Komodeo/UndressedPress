    <h2>Report: Large Coursework</h2>
    <h3>Grant Howard Brown</h3>
    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <blockquote>What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to
      implement.</blockquote>
    <p>The essential story being told by my site is that naturism is a popular and beneficial activity that can be
      enjoyed responsibly.</p>
    <p>My site is using a header and footer that contain basic information and links and a main section that contains
      articles and links to them. Because I am reproducing the functionality of a <a
        href="resources/February%202022_UP.pdf" target="_blank">pdf newsletter</a>, I went with a publication structure.
      Each article is a summary that links out to the full article, which is how they were presented in the newsletter.
      The content for each article is unique, so I tried to respect the layout of the original content as much as time
      allowed, while maintaining a consistent format for all the content.</p>

    <h4>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</h4>
    <blockquote>These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://hub.labs.coursera.org:443/connect/sharediwkssqut?forceRefresh=false&path=%2F"
          target="_blank">Jurassic Future (JF)</a>: Because I was on the team that created this website, I was already
        intimately familiar with it and had access to all the source materials, so it was a great starting point for my
        site structure, although it required major adaptations.</li>
      <li><a href="resources/February%202022_UP.pdf" target="_blank">Undressed Press pdf newsletter (UP)</a>: This was
        the main source material for the content and design of the website. I replicated the color scheme and the
        content of the articles (with some additional content from the source articles). I also tried to imitate the
        title and subtitle section of the header and the Share
        section of the footer based on UP.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.aanr.com/" target="_blank">AANR.com</a>: I took design inspiration from the <a
          href="http://www.aanr.com/aanr-articles-stories/?_categories=undressed-press" target="_blank">Undressed
          Press</a>
        section of the AANR website when designing the articles carousel on my homepage and the "Read More >>"
        button that I use across the site. I also pulled the AANR logo and edited it in PAINT.net. Additionally, I
        referenced the <a href="http://www.aanr.com/about-aanr/" target="_blank">About</a> section when building out the
        Mission statement for my footer.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>All images have alt attributes for visually-impaired users.</li>
      <li>All important text is machine-readable.</li>
      <li>The site displays well when magnified to 200% zoom.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>The site functions with or without javascript.</li>
      <li>The site displays well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.</li>
      <li>All important links can be accessed using the keyboard.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</h4>
    <blockquote>(i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a
      particular resource to make it work with your site).</blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>I did not understand how CSS grids worked when I started the project. I was able to figure it out mostly by
          poking through the South London Online Reading Group (SLORG) example that was included in our coursework. I
          also
          googled 'grid-template-columns' and came across <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns" target="_blank">helpful</a>
          MDN
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas" target="_blank">resources</a>.
          Using these and JF as reference points I was able to construct my grids. However, I wanted a header and footer
          whose internal elements were not related to each other, so this presented an additional challenge. I was able
          to
          figure it out through lots of experimentation and reading.</p>
        <p>I struggled to implement a separate header, footer, and main section with a single grid and eventually
          realized the way I wanted to do it was impossible without nested grids, so I used nested grids. I also
          realized through this process that the way I had my tags nested was not compatible with a grid structure, so I
          had to rewrite a lot of my code and change my site structure so my grids would work. This change is visible
          when you look at how my wireframes evolved as I built out the site.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even after my grids were constructed, I had a hard time figuring out how to make all my content align
          correctly. I researced CSS width and max-width and learned that setting a percentage for the value makes them
          dependent on their parent elements. Eventually, this clicked and I realized I needed a max-width argument set
          at
          the top level that was not a percentage and nested width arguments that were percentages. Once I figured this
          out, everything lined up nicely. However, I also learned I had to set max-width for my images so that they
          wouldn't cause my header and footer to overflow.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I only vaguely understood how media queries work before this project but I didn't have much trouble figuring
          them out. I googled media queries and found a useful W3schools <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp" target="_blank">resource</a>. The example from
          W3schools used inline styles, which I didn't want to do, so I googled 'change img src with css' and found a
          stackoverflow <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2182716/is-it-possible-to-set-the-equivalent-of-a-src-attribute-of-an-img-tag-in-css"
            target="_blank">solution</a>. I stitched together my code from the preceding examples but my hyperlinks
          weren't working correctly, so I googled 'content:url' and found an MDN <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url" target="_blank">resource</a> that helped me
          understand (from one of the examples) that I needed to append '../' to the beginning of my URL. I recognized
          the
          pattern as similar to what one would use in DOS/Windows command prompt to go up a level in a directory
          structure.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I'm happy with the design language of the site. I think I was able to create something that looks similar to the
        source material. It looks like it could have come from the same organization. It's also clean, simple, and
        well-organized. In my humble opinion, what I've presented is more professional and elegant than the source
        material.
      </li>
      <li>Accessibility and usability were key considerations and I think it shows. Looking at the HTML-only version of
        my site, everything is still fully functional and easy to navigate. The same is true whether you're on desktop,
        tablet, mobile, or if you are using a screen reader or magnification.</li>
      <li>My article page structure is flexible enough for multiple types of content. For example, one of the articles
        has Instagram embeds, which worked fine. Another had horizontal rules. Others had additional inline images. None
        of these presented an issue, as my css was slim enough not to interfere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm not a fan of the articles slider on the homepage. I'd much rather replace it with an articles grid that
        scales with the screen size but the slider was recommended and a faster way to demonstrate my ability to
        implement javascript. I also realize that my dots hover effect on mouseover is overwritten by my javascript but
        I didn't consider it a high enough priority to fix.</li>
      <li>The footer Share section is a little awkward and the logos don't display as uniformly as I'd like. I spent a
        lot of time on this and ended up having to move on from a solution that's not quite where I'd like it to be.
      </li>
      <li>The site is not very scalable. For example, the header and footer are statically coded on each page. This
        means that a single change to the header or footer has to be copied and pasted five times, and more if I were to
        add additional pages. Also, each article is constructed individually without a meaningful structure for the
        URLs, images, etc. If I were to scale the site up to support future newsletters, I'd need to rethink the
        directory structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What resources were used when creating your work?</h4>
    <blockquote>You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to
      create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the
      scripts.</blockquote>
