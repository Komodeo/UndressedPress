    <h4>Format for citing code:</h4>
    <blockquote>[1] Author Initial, Author Surname, 'Title of program/source code' (), Year Published. [Type]. Web
      address or publisher.</blockquote>

    <h4>Example:</h4>

      https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples/tree/master/example-minimal</blockquote>

    <h4>Format for citing online resource:</h4>
    <blockquote>[1] Author Initial. Author Surname, 'Title', Year Published. [Online]. Available: http://Website URL.
      [Accessed: 10- Oct- 2013].</blockquote>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <blockquote>[1] Handlebarsjs.com, 'Handlebars Reference', 2016. [Online]. Available:
      http://handlebarsjs.com/reference.html. [Accessed: 20- Sep- 2016].</blockquote>

    <h4>Taking things from the web</h4>
    <blockquote>You can use almost anything you like that you can find on the Web, but you should avoid anything that is
      not open (e.g. that costs money or requires login or registration), or anything from sites belonging to commercial
      companies. Being able to re-use other people's ideas is an important web skill. However, it is essential that, on
      your report page, you describe what you have taken, where you took it from, and what you have done to it. If you
      copy-and-paste something almost without change, you must say that you have done it, it must conform to the
      standards, and you shouldn't expect many marks for it, except for how you have made it fit in with and enhance
      your own design. To get more marks you can use code from elsewhere, document the source of the code in your
      report.html and then <strong>edit it in some way</strong>. Showing you can adapt existing code will earn you more
      marks. In order to be clear which material you have written and which you have used from elsewhere you will be
      expected to provide comprehensive comments within your HTML, CSS and Javascript files indicating code you have
      used, code you have adopted and edited and code that you have written.</blockquote>
