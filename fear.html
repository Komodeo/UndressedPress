      <em>This is part of Travel Firsts, a new series featuring trips that required a leap of faith or marked a major
        life milestone.</em>
      <p>I am uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>Sitting in the warm co-ed pool of <a href="https://harbin.org/" target="_blank">Harbin Hot Springs</a> in <a
          href="https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/northern-california-top-hotels" target="_blank">Northern
          California</a> and surrounded by strangers, I’ve
        elected once again to leave my <a
          href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-i-always-pack-a-bathing-suit-no-matter-where-im-going"
          target="_blank">bathing suit</a> bottoms on and remain only topless. Having been to an all female
        night at a <a href="https://kabukisprings.com/" target="_blank">Japanese-inspired bath house</a> once before, I
        am familiar with the concept of being <a
          href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-european-bathhouses-gave-me-the-freedom-to-accept-my-body"
          target="_blank">naked amongst
          strangers</a>. But this is the first time I am in broad daylight and in a mixed-gender environment. All
        around,
        wooden signs prohibit both conversation and sexual activity, though their casual tone sounds more like a
        suggestion than a rule.</p>
      <p>To my back and slightly up the paved incline is a small shrine shrouded in fig trees to <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin" target="_blank">Quan Yin</a>, which naked
        patrons of all ages bow in front of before making their way to the hot baths and the cold plunge to do “rounds.”
        To my left, a woman is audibly having an experience with a jacuzzi jet as we all pretend to ignore her; to my
        right is a couple cuddling on the steps; and deep in the far corner of the pool is a young woman with her nose
        buried in a paperback copy of <a href="https://taylorjenkinsreid.com/books/daisy-jones-and-the-six/"
          target="_blank"><em>Daisy Jones and The Six</em></a>. Damn, a book. That would have helped.</p>
      <p>Closing my shaded eyes, I try to slow my breathing. Faced with a choice, I could either storm out of the pool
        to wait for the friend I came with in the hot car, clothed but still uncomfortable; or I could take deep breaths
        and stay. Isn’t that the much touted goal of <a
          href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/airports-are-creating-inclusive-quiet-spaces-where-all-travelers-can-find-calm"
          target="_blank">meditation</a>, to stay still even whilst uncomfortable? I look up at
        the clock on the wall in front of me, reminiscent of the one at the local pool I swam at as a kid, and tell
        myself, <em>Thirty minutes. Just stay thirty minutes.</em></p>
      <aside>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>I couldn't help wondering: At 37 years old, why am I already—or, still—hesitating?</em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </aside>
      <p>Leaving me in the warm pool, my friend has already made her way toward the more intense hot and cold plunges.
        At 44, Ciana DeBernardo is a self-admitted <a
          href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-european-bathhouses-gave-me-the-freedom-to-accept-my-body"
          target="_blank">nude bathing convert</a>, as well as my nude bathing mentor. After her
        own first experience at 35, which was co-ed and “not easy,” she says she felt a radical transformation in
        herself and her comfort within her own body. She was immediately hooked.</p>
      <p>“It’s like anything—the more you do it, the easier it gets,” she says. “Especially as women, we can feel
        guarded, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve also realized this body won’t be around forever. Why not enjoy it while
        it’s still there?”</p>
