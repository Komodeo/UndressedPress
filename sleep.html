      <p>If there’s one place where it’s truly acceptable to be yourself, it should be the bedroom. No matter how
        conservative your attire in the outside world, in your bed you should be able to strip down to your birthday
        suit and feel those high thread count sheets against your bare behind. And though you run the risk of being
        walked in on by your kids (do give them a head’s up), <a
          href="https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/ways-to-fall-asleep-faster/" target="_blank">sleeping</a> nude
        may be worth it. Research shows there are
        many benefits of sleeping naked — it can improve not only your snooze, but also other aspects of your health. Is
        it better tto sleep naked though? Here’s what the research says about going au naturale come <a

      <h4>Sleeping Naked Helps You Fall Asleep Faster</h4>
      <p>If you’ve ever awoken in the night because you’re sweating bullets or it’s just too warm in your bedroom, then
        sleeping nude can help. According to research published in the <a
          href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427038/" target="_blank"><em>Journal of Physiological
            Anthropology</em></a>, “the
        effects on sleep stages differ depending on the use of bedding and/or clothing…because heat exposure increases
        wakefulness and decreases slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.” Clothing and excessive bedding may make
        it harder to fall asleep because your body isn’t at the optimal temperature.</p>

      <h4>Keeping Cool Improves Sleep Quality</h4>
      <p>The right temperature not only helps you get to sleep, but it improves sleep quality once you’re catching
        zzz’s. When room temperature is between 66 and 72 F, it helps the body’s sleep systems take over sooner.
        <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/131/2/500/407617" target="_blank">Research</a> has shown that
        the cooler you are under the sheets, the deeper you’ll sleep at night and the less
        likely you are to wake up in the middle of the night. So if you don’t have flannel pajamas holding in the heat,
        you’re much more likely to enjoy a good night’s rest.</p>

      <h4>Bare Skin in Bed Could Help You Lose Weight</h4>
      <p>While it may seems a bit far-fetched to think that sleeping naked could <a
          href="https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/ways-to-lose-weight/" target="_blank">help you shed pounds</a>,
        it’s actually
        true. An <a
          href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/cool-temperature-alters-human-fat-metabolism"
          target="_blank">NIH study</a> found that if your skin remains cooler while you’re sleeping, it can help you
        burn calories.
        Staying cool while you snooze speeds up your metabolism by producing more brown fat to keep you warm, which is
        actually good for losing weight. <a
          href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/expert-answers/brown-fat/faq-20058388"
          target="_blank">Brown fat</a> is a specific type of body fat that’s activated when you’re cold. It
        works to maintain your body temperature by breaking down glucose and fat molecules. And according to the study,
        “men exposed to a cool environment overnight for a month had an increase in brown fat with corresponding changes
        in metabolism.”</p>
