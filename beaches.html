      <p>We all like to be beside the seaside - but there are some brave folk out there who like the experience to be
        even more, ahem, natural.</p>
      <p>The wind in their hair, the breeze between the knees - and the sun on their buns - and there are a handful
        nudist beaches in Wales where you can do just that.</p>
      <p>Some are quite well known, others are just for those "in the know" - and there are often a number of local
        rules and regulations in place.</p>
      <p>According to the Crown Prosecution Service, naturists shouldn't be prosecuted unless they are involved in an
        offence other than public nudity. It says a balance needs to be struck between the naturist's right to freedom
        of expression and the right of the wider public to be protected from harassment, alarm and distress.</p>
      <p>So, with that in mind, we took at look at how nudists and naturists really felt about stripping down to the
        skin on the Welsh coast.</p>
      <h4>1. Whiteford Sands, Gower</h4>
      <p>Whiteford Sands is the most northernly beach on Gower, located on the edge of the Loughor estuary.</p>
      <p>The beach is well-known for being a naturist favourite, but according to a community forum, local residents are
        said 'not to approve' of such activities.</p>
      <p>With that being said, at two miles long, Whiteford Sands is very spacious, meaning you'll probably get more
        privacy than you'd expect.</p>
      <img src="img/article/whiteford-sands.jpg" alt="Whiteford Sands looking across the sands towards Penclawdd">
      <p>A reviewer on Naturist Guide said that some nudists at Whiteford Sands were "very chatty and extremely
        friendly".</p>
      <p>They said: "The only others I saw were a couple (clothed) and a single man on the flattish sand dunes just past
        the lighthouse. He stripped off when he saw me and turned out to be a very chatty and extremely friendly guy. I
        saw no-one else at all! Quite amazing considering the size of the beach.</p>
